deployed_vis
============

a processing project to display deployment information for a Soldier and Airmen

Additional files you will need will include font files. I use Georgia-24.vlw and Verdana-16.vlw. 

Also do a search for an image called "world32k.jpp" This image is placed on the globe and it fits seamlessly. 

You can use any image you want as long as it fits seamlessly around this globe.
